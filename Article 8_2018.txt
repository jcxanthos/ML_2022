Tesla Stock Has Plenty of Downside, With or Without Elon Musk

The possibility of Tesla without its founder, visionary, and CEO, Elon Musk, rattled investors Friday as Tesla shares have dropped $44.50, or 14%, to $263.02. The stock could fall further, whether or not the Securities and Exchange Commission succeeds in forcing him out as chairman and CEO.
The company remains a story stock with a history of losses whose high valuation relative to other major auto makers has rested on investor confidence in the volatile and charismatic Musk.
There’s still plenty of froth in Tesla’s (ticker: TSLA) share price. The company is valued at $45 billion, a slight discount to General Motors (GM), which has a market cap of $47 billion, and a premium to Ford Motor (F) at $36 billion.
Tesla has projected that it will be profitable in the second half of this year, but analysts still see a loss for the year and just $3 in earnings per share for 2019, meaning the stock trades for around 90 times forward earnings. That towers above the puny price-earnings ratios of six to 10 on major global auto stocks, which command the lowest valuation among any major industry group. Tesla is fortunate that it gets treated like a software business rather than a car maker.
Tesla, whose shares are off 16% this year, actually is outperforming Ford (down 25%) and GM (off 18%). There has been pressure on auto stocks globally in recent months because of concerns about demand, costs and tariffs. Ford hit a new 52-week low Friday and GM did so on Thursday.
GM, down nine cents Friday to $33.58, trades for less than six times projected 2018 earnings of $5.95 a share and yields 4.6%. Ford, at $9.25, up two cents, hit its lowest level since 2012 earlier Friday. It fetches under seven times projected 2018 earnings of $1.35 a share and yields 6.6%. GM is even cheaper adjusting for the $11.5 billion implied value of its Cruise self-driving car business, which received an investment from Softbank ’s Vision fund in the spring.
Musk’s role at Tesla is uncertain now that the SEC is seeking to bar him from serving as an officer and director of a public company, following his August tweet about having “funding secured” to take Tesla private at $420 a share.
The penalty sought by the SEC is extreme and is more severe than Wall Street was anticipating. Bernstein analyst Toni Sacconaghi wrote Friday that a lifetime ban is “unusual.” He cited the situation involving Martha Stewart, who in 2006 accepted a five-year ban from being a director CEO of a public company and a five-year limitation on any role as an officer or employee of a public company as part of an SEC settlement related to insider trading charges.

There could be some room for negotiation for Musk with the SEC that would leave him at Tesla’s helm. This was underscored by a report Friday on CNBC that Musk turned down a possible deal at the last minute with the SEC in which he would have been barred from serving as chairman for two years and pay an unspecified fine.
Tesla investors probably would have welcomed such a pact because it would have left him in place as CEO. If the SEC comes back with a similar offer, Musk would do well to reconsider it.
Musk’s response: “This unjustified action by the SEC leaves me deeply saddened and disappointed. I have always taken action in the best interests of truth, transparency and investors.” Tesla’s board backed Musk, saying that it is “fully confident” in him.
Wall Street analysts have been growing more critical of Tesla in recent months and there were a flurry of bearish notes on Friday. JP Morgan analyst Ryan Brinkman wrote that he sees “a number of negative implications” for Tesla shares from the SEC action. He wrote that if Musk can’t serve as an officer or director of Tesla it could “hasten the inevitable transition of Tesla shares toward being valued based on fundamentals alone (fundamentals which we have long held do not support a value close to the current trading price).” He carries an Underweight rating and price target of $195 a share.
Needham analyst Rajvindra Gill wrote; “A company that has been profitable only one or two quarters in its eight-year history since going public, having burned through nearly $9 billion of free cash flow since 2015, consistently missing targets, inability to make profit on $80k-$100k vehicles, and misguided acquisitions (Solar City) is on borrowed time, in our view. And therefore, Tesla is Mr. Musk and vice versa. Without him, we believe long-term investors will abandon the story.”
Tesla’s balance sheet also is an issue with the company carrying $9 billion of net debt. It faces a $920 million maturity of a convertible bond in March if its stock price is below about $360 a share. A Tesla bond issue due in 2025 yields more than 8%, against 6% for the average junk bond, reflecting investor concerns about the company. Brinkman added that “decreased confidence in Tesla on the part of investors may impact the company’s ability to raise capital on amenable terms.”
The company has projected profitability under generally accepted accounting principles in the second half of this year, but some analysts think the company will have to raise cash in the coming months. Cowen analyst Jeffrey Osborne wrote Friday that he thinks Tesla will need to raise $2 billion in the fourth quarter. He added that the SEC action could bolster civil shareholder cases against the company.
Part of the bull case for Tesla is that it is more than just a car company given its battery and self-driving-car technology. But Needham’s Gill argued in the client note that “competition is heating up from a technological perspective” and that the “premise” that Tesla has an advantage in batteries and autonomous cars “is diminishing, in our view.” Tesla also faces rising competition in electric cars from rivals in coming years.
All this suggests that investors may want to stay away from Tesla shares.
