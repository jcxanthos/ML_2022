BMW BMW 1.68%▲ faces mounting costs just as the car market is weakening. Best not to bet on a rebound in its shares—however cheap they look.
The Bavarian car maker published record second-quarter profits Tuesday. But the shares fell in morning trading. After stellar numbers from Daimler, which makes Mercedes, investors were underwhelmed by its rival’s more modest beat.
The bigger picture is that BMW is having to spend heavily to compete with Tesla and Google (and eventually Apple), just as the consumer buying cycle hits an inflection point.
Staff numbers at the end of June were 3.4% higher than a year earlier, after the company hired software developers and other digital technicians. Last month BMW also signed a deal with Mobileye and Intel to create an open platform for autonomous vehicles. The startup costs for this venture will be booked in the fourth quarter.
Meanwhile, the company flagged mounting competition as growth in the crucial U.S. market slowed to just 1.4% in the first half. BMW itself underperformed, selling 10% fewer cars than in the comparable period of 2015 at slightly cheaper prices. It expects a flat second half.
Still-booming sales in Europe and China more than made up for lost U.S. ground. Surprisingly, management also reported no weakness in U.K. sales following June’s Brexit vote. But China’s volatility and Europe’s tendency to follow U.S. trends make investors understandably nervous. BMW’s shares trade on just eight times forward earnings.
Eventually, new ownership models for all-autonomous cars may free manufacturers from being shackled to the whims of consumers. That hope looks closer to reality at BMW than at other European car makers. But it is still well beyond the horizon of even the most long-term stock investors.
